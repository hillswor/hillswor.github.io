There was no light bulb that went off in my head. There was no single moment of inspiration or clarity that made me decide to learn software development. The calling had been lurking in the background throughout my life. From making websites in the early days of the internet to landing an internship in at an upstart soft drink company that required me to help build a site on the fly, all things were pointing toward this path. Maybe I’m hardheaded or the time wasn’t right but I chose a different path, and then a different one, and a different one after that. While I value the lessons from each path I’ve chosen, the end result was the same for each. I was always left unfilfilled and unsatisfied. I love to build. I love to be challenged. I love to learn. I love to create. Software development checks all those boxes and always has.
